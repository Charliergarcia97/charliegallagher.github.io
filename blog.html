<h1>My Blog</h1>
<p>Hey there and welcome to my blog! As you may know, I upload a blog post every week. This weeks blog post is about my top 3 places in Donegal for photographers or even just people who enjoy a good view! With that being said, let's get into it!</p>

<h2>My top 3 places in Donegal</h2>

<h3>Sliabh Liag</h3>

<p>If you love heights, thrills and amazing views, you have to visit the highest sea cliffs in Europe! If you're interested in hiking and seek thrill and adrenaline, Sliabh Liag offers the famous yet dangerous "One Man's Path". This is a very narrow path (One person at a time) that stretches across the top of the cliffs. From here, and on a clear day, you can see well down The Wild Atlantic way, as you can see views of Mullaghmore, Sligo and even further! A truly beautiful location and easily in my top 3 in Ireland, let alone Donegal.</p>

<h3>Fanad Head</h3>
<p>Fanad is a peninsula that lies between Lough Swilly and Mulroy Bay on the north coast of County Donegal, Ireland. Whether you just want to visit and see it, while observing the breaktaking views or whether you plan on staying in the lighthouse, you won't be disappointed! Personally, I have spent a few nights in the lighthouse with my family. It was most definitely a unique experience, not many can say they have slept in a lighthouse. If you plan on staying in the lighthouse, and this may be controversial among different people, but I advise you aim to stay there when there's a storm, as it adds so much to the experience. Imagine being warm and cosy in the lighthouse, with electricity, a kitchen, multiple bedrooms and a living room all while the wind and rain batters the outside. Pair this with Halloween time as I did and you may or may not want to hear about the different ghost stories and folk tales. Whether or not you believe in it, it will add to an unforgettable experience. The photo opportunities are endless, with so many different views and angles and different points of interest on the drive to Fanad. A truly brilliant part of Donegal, a must see for everyone.</p>

<h3>Silver Strand Beach</h3>
<p>Located past Glencolumbkille, this beach is by far one of the nicest and most isolated beaches Donegal has to offer. Shaped like a crescent, you can walk either side of it on the high hills or you can make the walk down the stairs to the beach itself. Be warned, walking back up the stairs isn't as easy as going down. The stairs are incredibly steep and there's a lot of them! Also, don't be surprised if you're approached by sheep and/or rams, they're there to enjoy the view too! If you have a day free to travel and explore, I can't recommend Silver Strand enough. Even on the rainiest of days, it still makes for great views and a lovely walk on the beach. If you're fortunate enough to own a drone, this is one of the places you must fly it, it looks even more impressive from the skies!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This has been my blog post on my favourite 3 places to visit in Donegal. It goes wihtout saying that Donegal has even more to offer, with various mountain ranges, multiple wildlife and forest parks and many lakes, not to mention multiple hidden secret waterfalls, the list goes on and on. But for now, these are my Top Three in Donegal. Thanks for reading, happy exploring!</p>
