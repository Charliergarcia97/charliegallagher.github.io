        <h1>My Equipment</h1>


        <p>This is some of the equipment that I use as a photographer and film maker.</p>
    
        <p> 
        For me, I prefer to only carry equipment that is 100% necessary and convenient but also equipment that is guaranteed to produce high quality photos and videos. I tend to have a utilitarian outlook on my equipment so everything I use is highly functional and will enable me to capture whatever shots I have in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Cameras</h2>

        <h3>Sony A6400</h3>
        <p>
            This is the best camera I've ever used. Bought in 2019 and still relatively new, the Sony A6400 is an excellent choice for intermediate to professional photographers, as it it easy to use, captures a great image and also allows for the use of complex colour sciences to apply to videos for professional colour grading in the post production stage.

        </p>

        <h3>DJI Mavic Air 2</h3>
        <p>
        This is a drone that was released in 2020. The first drone I started off with was the DJI Mavic Pro in 2016. Since then drones have come a long way so I decided to upgrade to a smaller yet more powerful drone that can captiure even clearer images and videos. The Mavis Air 2 is a perfect drone for any users that range from Beginner to Advanced. Even if you have no prior experience with drone flying, the smart features and tutorials make this drone a piece of cake to fly, while capturing stunning 48mp photos and 4k60p video.

        </p>

        <h3>GoPro Hero 8</h3>
        <p>
            Before Covid 19 affected the world, I use to travel a lot. From the breathtaking views of the Grand Canyon to the unforgettable sunsets in Croatia to the crazy streets of Vietnam, I love to travel and document most of my journeys and be able to capture different videos I wouldn't be able to without the use of a GoPro. AFter starting out with the GoPro Hero 5, I fell in love with the size, image quality and convenience of these cameras. The size makes it barely noticable when holding or when using a certain mount, eg: a head mount or chest mount. Due to the waterproof features on these cameras, I have been able to dive into deep oceans with them and not have to worry about them getting any water damage.

        </p>

        <h2>Other Equipment</h2>

       <h3>RØDE VideoMic Pro</h3>
        <p>
            Sound quality is crucial for videos, especially videos in which people are talking. You want to be able to hear them clearly, even if it's windy outside. The RØDE VideoMic Pro allows creators to capture crystal clear audio, whether it's for an interview, a voiceover or even capturing nature sounds and ambience. Simply plug it into any camera that has a microphone jack and attach it to the hotshoe on top and you needn't worry from then on, the microphone will automatically turn on and capture the high quality sounds.

        </p>

        <h3>DJI Ronin SC</h3>
        <p>
            When filming videos, especially videos for companies and brands, you aim to have the high quality image but also smooth camera motions. Instead of using handheld footage which can be shaky, out of focus and overall unappealing, you can now pick up a semi-professional gimbal for your camera. This gimbal provides a three axis stabilization, which means footage will be smooth and will show signs of no "rocky" movements. One of these will cost around €600 but in my opinion, is one of the tools that is invaluable to film makers of all levels.

        </p>


       <h2>Editing Software</h2>

        <h3>Apple's Final Cut Pro</h3>
        <p>
            When I started out making videos back in 2015, the first proper software that I used was Final Cut Pro by Apple. At the time and still, it is one of two of the most commonly used editing softwares for anything from amateur videos to hollywood films. It can be easy to learn and once you figure out your own editing style you can edit any footage into a cinematic masterpiece. It can deal with 8k resolution videos now, you can work on sound design from within the app, you can professionally colour grade any footage and piece it all together to create something that was once considred impossible to make. The editing possibilies are endless, it just depends on how you edit.

        </p>

        <h3>Adobe's Lightroom</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to photo editing, there are a lot of different options that you can avail of. One of the most well known ones and also one of the best is Adobe's Lightroom, It works hand in hand with Adobe's Photoshop. You can tweak any image in a simple yet professional way. In just a few clicks you can transform any image into a beautifully edited photo. If you're on the content creator side of things like myself, you can even create your own presets, which are essentially filters you can use on your photos to give them a signature look. While it sounds basic, creating presets can take time and if you create high enough quality presets, you can even export them in preparation to sell. This is just one way for smaller content creators to make some money.

        </p>



      <p>These are the main pieces of equipment that I use to enable me to capture high quality photos, videos and sounds all while carrying a light but reliable bag.</p>
